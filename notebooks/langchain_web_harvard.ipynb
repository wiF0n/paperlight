      "The main question they were trying to answer was how to optimize the performance of these detectors and improve their imaging quality. To do this, they prepared and tested four pixelated detectors with different pixel sizes and technology preparations. They also carried out adjustments and energy calibrations using radioisotopes to ensure accurate detection of γ-photons.\n",

Moreover, the X-ray imaging quality of the GaAs Timepix detectors was found to be very promising, providing high-resolution images with excellent clarity.\n",
